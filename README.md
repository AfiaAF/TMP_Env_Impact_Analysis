# Environmental Impact of Food Production Analysis

## Project Overview

Food production is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation, including climate change, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. This project analyzes environmental data related to 43 common food products to understand their impact across metrics like carbon emissions, land use, water withdrawals, and eutrophication.

By identifying patterns and outliers in the environmental cost of food, we aim to inform more sustainable food production and consumption practices.

## Objectives

- Analyze environmental metrics of food production
- Identify which foods have the highest/lowest environmental impacts
- Compare plant-based vs animal-based foods
- Understand which stages of the food lifecycle are most impactful (e.g., farm, transport)
- Generate actionable insights for producers, policymakers, and consumers

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) | Data analysis & manipulation |
| **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** | Visualization (static & interactive) |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | Documentation and workflow |
| **GitHub** | Version control & project hosting |
| **Streamlit** | Dashboard |

## Dataset

The dataset contains environmental impact metrics for 43 food items and includes:

- Greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂eq per kg)
- Eutrophication (gPO₄eq)
- Land use (m²)
- Water usage (liters)
- Impact at various production stages: Land use change, Farm, Packaging, Retail, etc.

## Key Insights

- Beef and lamb have the highest carbon and land use footprints.
- Plant-based foods like lentils and potatoes show significantly lower emissions.
- Transport and packaging contribute less to total emissions than on-farm production.
